# Bike Index

A React-Test assigned to me by the Unifi Solutions company.

Things I have done:
- Searching page with 10 results per page, and including pagination.
- Displaying bike theft cases as cards with their information.
- Displaying information about found results numbers, (stolen, non-stolen, and total count).
- State visualization when fetching data, (loading, error, not-found).
- Filtering bike theft cases by status, (stolen, non-stolen, all).

Things I couldn't achieve using the API:
- Filtering bike theft cases by date range, (couldn't find any endpoint for that).
- Displaying the reporting date, (couldn't find any data given by the endpoints for that).

Technologies I used:
- ReactJS.
- SCSS (only a little).
- TypeScript.
- StyledComponents.
- Axios.
- LazyLoadingImages.

Overall it was a great time having an assignment to do to be reviewed ðŸ˜….
